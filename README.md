# Real-time Slide Show with Node.Js, Express and Socket.io

A project that I created to learn Socket.io applications. 

![This is an image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omerization/realtime-slide-show/master/imgs/realtime-slider1.gif)

On the left `localhost:3000` and on the right `localhost:3000/edit` opened in two different browser windows

# Install the project
```
git clone https://github.com/nafeu/realtime-slides-tut.git [PROJECT_NAME]
cd [PROJECT_NAME]
npm install
```

# Usage

Run npm start inside the project directory.

#### Presentation
Open `localhost:3000` in your browser

#### Slide Changer 
Open `localhost:3000/edit` in another window or `[LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS]:8000/edit` on any device (computer, tablet or phone) that is on the same LAN.
